I got an email today that my site had malware. It was a Wordpress site that I didn't really maintain, so I guess I 
shouldn't be surprised.

So I said "forget this" and deleted my blog.

I've been meaning to rewrite it for a long time. But each time I started, I'd think "I should really version control 
this. And then automatically deploy on a commit. But to a staging environment first, then to production. Should the 
staging environment be behind a login? Also I'll need to bundle styles and scripts and minify everything and serve it 
from a CDN."

I'm exhausted just from typing it. So I'm writing up this page in gedit, and I'll upload it as index.html in 
FileZilla. Why? Because those tools are the ones I have handy. Maybe this site will some day be more complex. But for 
now? It's easy.
