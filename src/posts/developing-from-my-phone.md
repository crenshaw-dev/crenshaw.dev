I installed an FTP client and text editor on my phone. Writing HTML is a bit unwieldy with the mobile keyboard, but it 
works.

Once I'm back to my keyboard, I'll attempt to make individual "pages" out of my blog posts, using the history API.

I'm thinking all requests will have to be served index.html via server-side rewrites and particular posts shown 
according to the URL by JavaScript. I'm still not sure how to handle 404 errors.

**Update**: I'm back at my desktop and wouldn't want to develop from a mobile device for extended periods of time.
