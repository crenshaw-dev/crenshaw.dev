Jumping out of the dark and shouting "BOO!" at a friend is fun. Why? Because they start, maybe scream, generally act 
scared. Then of course, they realize that instead of a menacing ghost it's a good friend, and you both enjoy a good 
laugh.

Humans jump to conclusions, and they do it quickly.

If you're a fan of evolutionary biology, you might believe the tendency to jump to conclusions emerged out of a higher 
survival rate for those who did. If your brain says "I think I see a bear," its time is better spent calculating 
escape routes than contemplating, "Well what if it's just a funny-looking tree?"

If you believe god(s) made the human mind pretty much the way it is, it's reasonable to suspect she/he/it/they 
designed the brain to think fast and therefore live longer and more happily.

As web user experience designers, we tend to think of "experiences" as activities such as "switching tabs" or 
"clicking the play button."

But some experiences are moments rather than activities. Your mind sees an image and, by nature, must draw a 
conclusion.

If the image presented by a user interface is likely to be interpreted in a negative way ("This interface is 
ugly/confusing/irritating."), it doesn't matter if 500 milliseconds later everything looks great. Your interface 
yelled "BOO!", your user is scared, and the rest of the experience is contaminated by that negative feeling.

In some later post I'll argue that progressive JPEGs (images that initially load low-quality but then improve) are 
perceived with more negative emotions than baseline JPEGs (images that load top-to-bottom) because of the conclusions 
to which the user jumps in the first few milliseconds of the loading process.

For now I'll simply assert: user experience must be designed with an eye toward moments (even ones that last mere 
milliseconds) because of the human need to jump to conclusions.
