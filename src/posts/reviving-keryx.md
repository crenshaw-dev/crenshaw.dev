Keryx is an offline package manager for Debian-based operating systems.

On my previous blog, I wrote "Reviving Keryx" announcing my intention to refactor and bring the project back to life.

But then life happened. I haven't pulled up the Keryx source code in a long time.

Keryx provided a huge service for the Linux community, impacting people around the world. I wish I were in a position 
to continue development.

If you've landed on this page and need something like Keryx in your life, please hit me up 
[@m4c9416](https://twitter.com/m4c9416) on Twitter and let me know. If there's enough continued interest, I might 
carve out enough time to update the code base.
